# How to use
1) Download latest version of ds4uo.exe from [here](https://github.com/TheTweak/pyjoymapper/releases) (or clone the repo and install requirements.txt to run from source).
2) Connect DS4 controller
3) Start ds4uo.exe (or run `python main.py`)
4) Mouse cursor will become locked in screen center, this is required to make your character Walk / Run. Press "Share" button to toggle joystick control On / Off, and unlock your cursor.
5) DS4UO is using absolute coordinates to position mouse cursor, so your Ultima Online window must be centered for Walk/Run to work properly.
